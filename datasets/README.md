# Dataset

## Data Format
There are three datasets: **CounterFact**, **MQuAKE-CF**, and **WikiUpdate** in JSON.  
A sample in them looks like

    {
        "case_id": 8,
        "pararel_idx": 14780,
        "requested_rewrite": {
            "prompt": "What is the twin city of {}? It is",

The explanations are

- `requested_rewrite`: The requested rewrite information for editing, with the following fields:
    - `subject`: The subject.
    - `prompt`: The prompt template.
    - `prompt_full`: The full prompt with `subject`.
    - `relation_id`: The relation id defined in Wikidata.
    - `target_new`: The new entity (object).
        - `str`: Entity name.
        - `id`: The entity ID in Wikidata.
    - `target_true`: The old entity (object).
        - `str`: Entity name.
        - `id`: The entity ID in Wikidata.
    - `answer_new`: The new answer to be edited into a language model.
    - `answer_new_alias`: The aliases of `answer_new`.
    - `answer_true`: The old answer.
    - `answer_true_alias`: The aliases of `answer_true`.
    - `question`: The question used for query.
    - `fact_new`: The new fact with `target_new`.
    - `fact_new_uns`: The unstructured fact, generated by ChatGPT in **CounterFact** and **MQuAKE-CF** or retrieved from **Wikipedia** in WikiUpdate.
    - `verify_unsfact_GPT`: The verification result. We use ChatGPT to verify if the `fact_new_uns` aligns with `fact_new`.
    - `unsfact_triplets_GPT`: Extracted triplets from `fact_new_uns` by ChatGPT.
        - `subject`: The subject of a triplet.
        - `prompt`: The relation of a triplet.
        - `target`: The object of a triplet.
    - `time_true`:
        - `start_time`: The start time of the fact with `target_true` as the object.
        - `end_time`: The end time.
    - `time_new`:
        - `start_time`: The start time of the fact with `target_new` as the object.
        - `end_time`: The end time. This value is `null` in most cases.


`time_true` and `time_new` only exist in **WikiUpdate**.
